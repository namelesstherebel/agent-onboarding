# Improvement Queue

**Repository:** [project name]
**Runtime installed:** [date]

This file is the single source of truth for all improvement proposals generated by agents operating in this environment. Proposals are appended here automatically when friction thresholds are met or errors reveal structural gaps. Review and process proposals using the `/review` command.

## How to Use This File

**To review proposals:** Use the `/review` command. Do not manually edit PENDING proposals — the review command handles formatting and status updates.

**To understand a proposal:** Each proposal includes root cause, the specific proposed change written out in full, confidence level, and whether a human judgment call is required. Read all fields before deciding.

**To reject without re-proposing:** Set status to `REJECTED` and include a reason. The agent will not re-surface this specific proposal. If you want the agent to reconsider after more data, note that in the rejection reason.

**INTENT.md proposals:** These are flagged with ⚠️ and require explicit confirmation (`APPROVE INTENT CHANGE`). They represent changes to core agent behavior and should be treated with more scrutiny than spec proposals.
